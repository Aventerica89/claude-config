## Browser Extensions

### Env Var Assistant - Auto-paste secrets to dashboards
**Added:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Idea

A browser extension + 1Password integration for storing API keys and automatically entering them into provider dashboards.

**Architecture:**
```
Claude Chat → 1Password CLI (op) → 1Password Vault
                                        ↓
Browser Extension ← 1Password Connect/API
        ↓
Dashboard Automation (navigate + fill + click)
```

**1Password Integration:**
- Store secrets via `op` CLI with tags and metadata
- Use custom fields to store target dashboard URL and field selectors
- 1Password Connect (self-hosted REST API) for extension access
- Native messaging bridge between extension and 1Password

**Browser Extension Role:**
- Read tagged items from 1Password (via Connect or native messaging)
- Maintain manifest of dashboard selectors (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Supabase, etc.)
- Navigate to stored URL for each secret
- Content script finds fields, fills values, clicks save

**Advantages:**
- No secret storage in extension - 1Password handles all security
- Cross-device sync via 1Password
- Full audit trail in 1Password
- Could leverage 1Password's existing autofill UI
- Pattern matching for common formats (`API_KEY=`, `sk-...`, `ghp_...`, etc.)

**Potential Extensions:**
- MCP server integration - Claude invokes "store this key for Cloudflare"
- Batch mode for setting up new projects (multiple env vars at once)
- Dashboard selector manifest as community-maintained repo

### 1Password Token Storage Workflow
**Added:** 2026-01-27
**Status:** Idea

Simple workflow for storing one-time access tokens/API keys directly to 1Password.

**Concept:**
When you generate a one-time token (Supabase CLI, Vercel, etc.), store it in 1Password under the site's existing login entry as an additional password field.

**Structure in 1Password:**
```
Site: Supabase (existing login)
├── Username: user@email.com
├── Password: ********
├── Access Token: sbp_xxxxx          ← NEW
│   └── Label: "CLI Access Token"
│   └── Notes: "Generated 2026-01-27 for jb-cloud-app-tracker"
└── URL: https://supabase.com
```

**CLI Integration:**
```bash
# Store token under existing login
op item edit "Supabase" "Access Token[password]=sbp_xxxxx" --vault Personal

# Or create new section
op item edit "Supabase" "CLI Tokens.Token Name[password]=value"
```

**Benefits:**
- Keeps tokens with their related service login
- No separate vault/item clutter
- Easy to find when you need it
- Can add description/date for context
- Works with existing 1Password workflow
