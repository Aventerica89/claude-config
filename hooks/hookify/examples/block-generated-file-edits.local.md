**Direct edit to auto-generated file blocked!**

Files in `landing/src/lib/generated/` are auto-generated by `scripts/generate-brain-data.mjs`.

**Instead:**
- Edit source markdown in `commands/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, or `rules/`
- Run `cd landing && npm run generate` to regenerate
- Or let `prebuild`/`predev` scripts handle it automatically
