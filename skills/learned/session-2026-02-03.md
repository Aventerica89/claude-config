# Session: 2026-02-03

## Projects Worked On
- jb-cloud-docs (Aventerica89/jb-cloud-docs)
- claude-codex / CLAUDE.md configuration

## Accomplished

### jb-cloud-docs - PR Review Fixes
- Reviewed cubic's automated code review on PR #17 (6 issues found)
- Validated issues: 4 valid, 1 invalid, 1 uncertain
- Created PR #18 to fix documentation issues:
  - `better-auth/setup.mdx` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL env var with variable expansion
  - `vercel/cli/environment.md` - Fixed misleading shell history security claim
  - `vercel/ai-sdk/migration.md` - Added missing generateText import
  - `vercel/cli/deployment.md` - Removed non-existent --preview flag
  - `vercel/ai-gateway.mdx` - Clarified Claude Code Max gateway auth requirements
- Ran /routine-merge with Cubic + Gemini reviews
- Implemented Gemini's suggestion (env var expansion)
- Merged PR #18 successfully

### CLAUDE.md Updates
- Added all 37 repositories organized by category:
  - Healthcare/Medical (7 repos)
  - WordPress/Bricks (5 repos)
  - Claude Code/Dev Tools (7 repos)
  - Infrastructure/Utilities (8 repos)
  - Other Projects (4 repos)
  - External/Forked (2 repos)
- Added descriptions for each repo based on user input

## Patterns Learned

### /routine-merge Workflow
1. Check PR status and existing reviews
2. Wait for Cubic automated review
3. Request Gemini review via @gemini-code-assist comment
4. Evaluate feedback (CRITICAL auto-fix, HIGH prompt user)
5. Implement suggestions and push
6. Re-run reviews if code changed
7. Merge when all gates pass

### Cubic vs Gemini
- Cubic: Fast, catches doc inconsistencies, security issues
- Gemini: Slower, provides refactoring suggestions, code quality

### /routine-sync vs /routine-merge
- sync = pull upstream into your branch (during dev)
- merge = merge PR into main (after reviews pass)

## Next Session
- No specific pending tasks
- jb-cloud-docs build still failing (pre-existing bricks-cc/ orphaned pages issue)

## Files Changed
- /Users/jb/.claude/CLAUDE.md - Added repository catalog
- /tmp/jb-cloud-docs/src/content/docs/* - 5 doc fixes (merged)
